        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="experience">
          <p>Hello! 👋 I'm Scott Watanuki, a rising junior and Computer Science major at the Georgia Institute of Technology.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I grew up in Honolulu, HI 🌊 and graduated 'Iolani School.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I've been a Software Engineer Intern at GL Navigation's AI Team since June 2022, where I've been working on backend and machine learning development.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Additionally, I've conducted research and developed an AI model to diagnose cataracts through the John and Violet Kay Summer Research Fellowship during Summer/Fall of 2021.</p>
          <br>
          <p>During my free time, I love being outdoors 🚴🏻‍♂️ 🏌️‍♂️, reading books 📖, listening to music 🎧, traveling to new places ✈️, building new things 🧑🏻‍💻, and meeting new people 🤝!</p>
          <br>
          <p>I'm constantly seeking for new opportunities where I can learn and grow as a software engineer. I'm excited to see where my love for technology and innovation will take me!</p>
          <br>
          <p>Thank you so much for taking the time to visit my website! 😊</p>
