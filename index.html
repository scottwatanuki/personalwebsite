        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="experience">
          <p>Hello!👋 I'm Scott Watanuki, a rising junior and Computer Science major at the Georgia Institute of Technology.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I grew up in Honolulu, HI 🌊 and graduated 'Iolani School.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I'm currently a Software Engineer Intern at GL Navigation's Machine Learning team, where I work on backend and machine learning.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I've had the privilege of working as a Software Engineer Intern at GL Navigation since June 2022. Additionally, I've conducted independent research through the John and Violet Kay Summer Research Fellowship to develop an AI model to diagnose cataracts during the Summer/Fall of 2021.</p>
          <br>
          <p>My interests lie in machine learning and distributed systems (back-end). (As you can probably tell, I'm a newbie to frontend!) </p>
          <br>
          <p>During my free time, I love being outdoors 🚴🏻‍♂️ 🏌️‍♂️, reading books 📖, listening to music 🎧, traveling to new places ✈️, building new things 🧑🏻‍💻, and meeting new people 🤝!</p>
          <br>
          <p>I'm constantly seeking for new opportunities where I can learn and grow as a software engineer. I'm excited to see where my love for technology and innovation will take me!</p>
          <br>
          <p>Thank you so much for taking the time to visit my website! 😊</p>
